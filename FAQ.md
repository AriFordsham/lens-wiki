h4. <a name="goals">Q:</a> What are the goals of this project? Why does this project exist?

*A:* The `lens` library exists to provide more composable versions of the abstractions you already know how to use in Haskell. Every Haskell programmer already knows how to work with functors and functions or `Foldable` and `Traversable` containers. 

We simply provide you with a vocabulary for composing them and working with their compositions.
