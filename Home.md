Welcome to the lens wiki!

You probably want to start with some [Examples](wiki/Examples), the [Overview](wiki/Overview) or a cheatsheet of many of the [Operators](wiki/Operators).

If you are interested in the design behind these lenses, you may want to also dig into their [Derivation](wiki/Derivation).

Please help us by expanding the [FAQ](wiki/FAQ).

A quick overview of the key operations of the core of the hierarchy of lens types can be seen below.

Contact Information
-------------------

Contributions and bug reports are welcome!  Please, feel free to update the content, as this is much more useful as a living
document than as something that gets updated when I remember to do so.

I can be contacted through github or on the #haskell or #haskell-lens IRC channels on irc.freenode.net.
