Welcome to the lens wiki!

You probably want to start with the [Tutorial](wiki/Tutorial).

If you are interested in the design behind these lenses, you may want to also dig into their [Derivation](wiki/Derivation).

Contact Information
-------------------

Contributions and bug reports are welcome!  Please, feel free to update the content, as this is much more useful as a living
document than as something that gets updated when I remember to do so.

I can be contacted through github or on the #haskell IRC channel on irc.freenode.net.
